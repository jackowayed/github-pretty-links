Bring back links with master! Greasemonkey script replaces the long commit key with "master" in links on github selectively, attempting to make the site just like how it was before.
</div>


<p>Uses greasemonkey to get the old github master links back, selectively for when you actually want them (ie. when they were "master" back before they changed them)</p>

p{color:#500; size:20pt;}. THIS MAY REPLACE THE COMMIT ID WITH THE BRANCH NAME ON LINKS YOU DON'T WANT IT TO. I THINK I HAVE MOST CASES COVERED, BUT I'M SURE THERE ARE MORE. You can always just click on the little monkey at the bottom to turn off greasemonkey and reload if you run into that. Also, _please_ help make the script better by "reporting a bug":http://wiki.github.com/jackowayed/github-pretty-links/bugs 

h2. Example

<pre>http://github.com/jackowayed/github-pretty-links/blob/7fc7f1ee758a9582c28fc5bc834100a97641e944/github-pretty-links.user.js</pre>

Turns into:

h2. What Exactly It Does

The links automatically change on the site thanks to the magic of Greasemonkey. All you have to do is have it enabled and it will rapidly change the links on the page each time you load a page on github. 

It knows when you're in the history page and other times when you're looking at a link that's meant to be to a specific commit and doesn't change in those cases. (At least most of the time it knows.)

It also knows when you're on a branch other than master and replaces with that branchname.
